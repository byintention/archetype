<h1 id="archetypethemeforclassicpress">Archetype theme for ClassicPress</h1>

<p>Blog style theme for ClassicPress with sidebar and full width page templates.</p>

<p>The customiser screen allows you to choose site colours and whether to show a header logo, or site title and tagline. Adding a featured image to a page will show the banner, and adding a caption will add text over the banner.</p>

<p>Please set a page to use the &#8216;Style test page&#8217; template to see various included styles, utility classes and the grid system.</p>

<p>Notifications and smaller and larger text can be set from the editor toolbar under the &#8216;styles&#8217; dropdown.</p>

<p>Archetype follows WordPress Coding Standards, meets WCAG AA contrast ratios with it&#8217;s default colours and is translation ready.</p>
