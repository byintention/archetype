# Archetype theme for ClassicPress
Blog style theme for ClassicPress with sidebar and full width page templates. Adding a featured image to a page will show it as a banner, and adding a caption will add text over the banner.

The customiser screen allows you to choose site colours and whether to show a header logo, or site title and tagline. 

Please set a page to use the 'Style test page' template to see various included styles, utility classes and the grid system.

Notifications and smaller and larger text can be set from the editor toolbar under the 'styles' dropdown. 

Breadcrumbs on single blog posts are built in and will display if enabled in SEOPress or YoastSEO.

Archetype follows WordPress Coding Standards, meets WCAG AA contrast ratios with it's default colours and is translation ready.
